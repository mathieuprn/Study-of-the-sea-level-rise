# Study-of-the-sea-level-rise
The aim of this project was to study the sea level rise from 1998 to 2016 and to predict from these data the sea level in 2100.  The technologies used during this project were NoSQL and Google Cloud Platform

The aim of this project was to study the sea level rise from 1998 to 2016 and to predict from these data the sea level in 2100.

The project was divided into 3 main parts:

1) A first part of data visualization: trying to see if a rise in water level is observable
2) In a second part, we tried to identifies important relationships in ssh with the technique of decomposition into principal components (PCA).
3) In the last part, we tried to predict the rise in ocean levels by means of different techniques (SVR, Regression, Neural Network,...)
